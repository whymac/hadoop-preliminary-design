# since the pandas cannot be used in hadoop cluster now, test the mapper and reducer by using cloudera command line first

>>>cat sample_positions.csv | python mapper_raw.py | sort -n | python reducer_raw.py

# then use the data in the test_data folder to replace the return_dataframe so that there will be 20 observations

>>>python mapper_create.py | sort -n | python reducer_create.py

>>>python mapper_rolling.py | sort -n | python reducer_rolling.py
